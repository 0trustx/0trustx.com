        <h4>Communications Shielding</h4>
        <p>Communication security unbreakable even against future quantum computing threats, with protection against denial-of-service, jamming, and MITM attacks. Runs on standard 5G devices already on the market.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="capability-card">
        <h4>Threat Detection</h4>
        <p>5G device-centric detection of abnormalities from SA and NSA basestations, identifying both known signature attacks and unknown zero-day threats.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="capability-card">
        <h4>5G Core Security</h4>
        <p>Zero-trust security enforcement for cloud-native 5G control plane microservices, achieving significant reductions in resource utilization and latency over existing solutions.</p>
