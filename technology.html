      <p>The Zero Trust X technology suite addresses 5G security through three complementary approaches: device-centric threat detection for identifying basestation-level attacks, quantum-proof communications shielding deployed on commercial devices, and zero-trust security enforcement for cloud-native 5G core networks.</p>

    <div class="content-section">
      <h2>Communications Shielding</h2>
      <p>Communication security that remains unbreakable even against future quantum computing threats, running directly on standard 5G devices already available on the market.</p>

      <h3>Key Features</h3>
      <ul class="feature-list">
        <li>Denial-of-service (DoS) attack protection</li>
        <li>Jamming attack protection</li>
        <li>Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack protection</li>
        <li>Quantum-proof data confidentiality</li>
        <li>Deployed on standard 5G COTS UE devices</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Performance</h3>
      <ul class="feature-list">
        <li><strong>Provable data availability</strong> guaranteed</li>
        <li><strong>Provable data confidentiality</strong> guaranteed</li>

    <div class="content-section">
      <h2>Threat Detection</h2>
      <p>A 5G device-centric threat detection system that identifies abnormalities from 5G Standalone (SA) and Non-Standalone (NSA) basestations.</p>
      <ul class="feature-list">
        <li>Detects known signature-based attacks</li>
        <li>Detects unknown and zero-day attacks through anomaly analysis</li>
        <li>Device-centric approach requiring no infrastructure-side deployment</li>
      </ul>
      <p><em>Deployed and verified against controlled malicious 5G base stations in lab environments.</em></p>

      <h2>5G Core Security</h2>
      <p>Zero Trust X Security Enforcement Microservice (ZTX-SEM) is a protocol-agnostic zero-trust security solution designed for cloud-native 5G control plane deployments. It secures complex network functions deployed as microservices in Kubernetes environments.</p>

      <h3>Key Features</h3>
      <ul class="feature-list">
        <li>Protocol-agnostic security across all communication protocols</li>
        <li>Lightweight packet interception mechanism</li>
        <li>Proactive authentication strategy that reduces latency and ensures continuous readiness</li>
        <li>Optimized secret key lookup for accelerated encrypted communication</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Performance</h3>
      <p>Tested on a Kubernetes-deployed 5G control plane (core), ZTX-SEM outperforms existing solutions such as Istio:</p>
      <ul class="feature-list">
        <li><strong>75% reduction</strong> in resource utilization</li>
        <li><strong>28% reduction</strong> in session setup times</li>
      </ul>
